# *SOC Analyst 30-Day Challenge*

# 🛡️***30-Day SOC Analyst Hands-On Cybersecurity Challenge***

This repository documents my 30-day hands-on SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst Challenge. Each day focuses on a practical blue team skill — from log analysis and threat detection to incident response and EDR-based monitoring — using real-world tools like Splunk, Wazuh, Wireshark, Suricata, and forensic platforms.

**Built as part of my cybersecurity self-learning journey and portfolio.**

## 🧠 What I Learned
- 🔎 Log analysis (Windows, Linux, IDS, HTTP, SSH, UFW)
- 📊 Splunk SPL searches for network & host-based indicators
- 🛡️ Incident response & containment (brute force, malware, phishing)
- 🧪 Threat detection using Wazuh EDR and Suricata IDS
- 🧰 Forensic techniques using VirusTotal, URLScan, CyberChef, etc.

## 📌 Domains Covered

- 📝 Log Analysis
- 🌐 Network Traffic & Packet Analysis (Wireshark)
- 🚨 Incident Response
- 📊 Splunk Investigations
