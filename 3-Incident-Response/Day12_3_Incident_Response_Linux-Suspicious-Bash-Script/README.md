# 🛡️ Day 12 – Incident Response - Linux Suspicious Bash Script Execution

## 📌 Objective
This lab helped understand the core steps of incident response by investigating a suspicious bash script execution on a Linux system. I simulated the malicious script and executed the script in Kali Linux to learn how to detect, analyze, and respond to a basic script-based intrusion.

📘 What is Incident Response?
Incident Response (IR) is the process of detecting and managing a cybersecurity incident to minimize impact and restore normal operations. This lab introduces a basic Linux scenario where an attacker’s script is executed through user error or misconfiguration.

🔁 Incident Response Process (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2)

| **Phase**           | **Description**                |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1. Preparation  | Ensure logging is enabled, tools are installed, and the system is ready   |
| 2. Detection and Analysis  | Identify suspicious activity using logs, running processes, and file checks.  |
| 3. Containment, Eradication, Recovery | Isolatethe threat, remove the script, and secure the system.    |
| 4. Post-Incident Activity | Document the incident and implement prevention steps.    |

###⚠️ Scenario: Suspicious Script Found in /tmp
Your monitoring system flagged a suspicious file in /tmp. Upon inspection, it's a bash script (payload.sh) that connects to an unknown IP. You are tasked with investigating this incident.
