## What is Phishing Analysis?

**Phishing Analysis** is the process of investigating suspicious emails to determine if they aim to deceive users into revealing sensitive information or executing malicious code. This includes analyzing metadata, links, attachments, and content for red flags.

## Task: Investigating a Lookalike Domain Email

### Scenario:
Your SOC received an email claiming to be from PayPal, sent from: noreply@secure-paypai.com

### Question 1:  
What is the reputation of the domain?

## Use tools like:
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- [Talos Intelligence](https://talosintelligence.com/)
- [Whois Lookup](https://who.is/)
- [AbuseIPDB](https://abuseipdb.com/)
- [MxToolBox](https://mxtoolbox.com/)

## Phishing Analysis Summary
I investigated the suspicious sender domain noreply@secure-paypai.com, which impersonates PayPal using a lookalike domain (secure-paypai.com). I used multiple tools ‚Äî VirusTotal, Whois Lookup, and MxToolBox ‚Äî to assess its reputation. All sources flagged the domain as associated with phishing activity. The investigation confirmed display name spoofing and URL deception, commonly used in credential-harvesting campaigns.
