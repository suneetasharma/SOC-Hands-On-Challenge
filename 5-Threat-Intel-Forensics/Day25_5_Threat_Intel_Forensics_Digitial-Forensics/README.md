# # üõ°Ô∏è Day 25 ‚Äì Digital Forensics: Memory Acquisition with AVML

---

## Objective

This lab introduces the basics of digital forensics by guiding through the acquisition of a Linux memory dump using Microsoft's AVML tool. The goal is to learn how to collect live memory from an Ubuntu system, validate the captured image, and securely transfer it to a forensic analysis workstation.

## What is Digital Forensics?

**Digital Forensics** is the science of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence in a legally admissible way. It plays a critical role in cybercrime investigations, insider threat analysis, data breaches, and incident response.

---

## Goals of Digital Forensics

- Identify and preserve digital evidence  
- Reconstruct timelines of malicious or suspicious activity  
- Determine the root cause of incidents or intrusions  
- Support legal or administrative proceedings  
- Maintain evidence integrity and chain of custody

## Types of Digital Forensics

| **Type**               | **Description**               | **Common Tools**          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| Linux Forensics | Investigating logs, memory, and files on Linux systems | log2timeline, auditd, grep, KAPE, AVML |
| Windows Forensics  | Registry, Event Logs, and file analysis | FTK Imager, Registry Explorer, KAPE, PECmd  |
| Mobile Forensics | Recovering deleted data, call logs, chat artifacts  | Cellebrite, Magnet AXIOM, MobSF   |
| Network Forensics | Analyzing captured packets and intrusion traces  | Wireshark, tcpdump, Zeek, Suricata     |
| Memory Forensics  | Live RAM acquisition and volatile data analysis  | AVML, Volatility, Rekall, LiME   |
| Cloud Forensics  | Logs, API usage, and activity in cloud environments  | AWS CloudTrail, Azure Sentinel, FIR    |
| IoT Forensics   | Firmware and embedded device investigation | Autopsy, Binwalk, Firmware-Mod-Kit   |

## Digital Forensics Process

| **Step**       | **Description**             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identification | Identify systems or data relevant to the incident     |
| Preservation   | Isolate the system to prevent tampering and maintain data integrity  |
| Collection     | Acquire volatile (RAM) and non-volatile (disk) evidence     |
| Analysis       | Examine collected data for malicious activity and IOCs    |
| Reporting      | Document findings, preserve logs/screenshots, and outline next steps  |

## Lab Setup

### Requirements:
- **System 1 (Target)**: Ubuntu 22.04 [ss-ubuntu] ‚Äì where memory will be captured  
- **System 2 (Analysis)**: Kali Server [ss-kali] ‚Äì where memory will be transferred  
- **User Access**: `sudo` privileges on both systems  

### Tools:
- [AVML (by Microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/avml) ‚Äì memory acquisition  
- `strings`, `grep` ‚Äì for quick validation  
- `scp` or `rsync` ‚Äì for secure transfer

## Lab Tasks ‚Äì Acquire and Transfer Linux Memory Dump

### Step 1: Download AVML
```bash
wget https://github.com/microsoft/avml/releases/latest/download/avml
```

### Step 2: Make AVML Executable
Grant execute permissions:
```
chmod +x ./avml
Verify execution by running:
./avml --help
```

</p>

### Step 3: Create a Memory Dump
Run the following command to acquire a memory dump and save it as linux_memory.mem:
```
sudo ./avml linux_memory.mem
Confirm the memory dump file has been created:
ls -lh linux_memory.mem
```

</p>


### Step 4: Validate the Memory Dump
Use strings and grep to check if known data appears in the dump:
```
strings linux_memory.mem | grep "mozilla"
```
If strings related to applications, files, or processes appear, the dump is valid.

### Step 5: Transfer the Memory Dump to the Analysis Machine
On the forensic workstation: create a directory to store the memory dump:
```
mkdir ~/forensics/memory_dumps
```
Transfer the memory dump from the Target Machine to the Analysis Machine using scp:
```
scp user@<192.168.70.4>:/home/user/linux_memory.mem ~/forensics/memory_dumps/
```
Verify the file is successfully transferred:
```
ls -lh ~/forensics/memory_dumps/
```

## Submission Checklist
- ‚úÖ Screenshot of linux_memory.mem file created on Target Machine
- ‚úÖ Screenshot of the memory dump file inside ~/forensics/memory_dumps/ on the Analysis Machine
- ‚úÖ Optional: Screenshot of strings | grep output showing memory content

## Observation
Memory acquisition is a critical part of digital forensics and incident response. Capturing volatile data such as running processes, open files, command-line history, and encryption keys can provide valuable insights during investigations ‚Äî especially when the system might be compromised or about to be shut down. Live memory can expose evidence that does not persist on disk, helping forensic analysts uncover real-time behavior and advanced malware techniques.

## Learning Outcome
By completing this lab, I learned how to:
- Safely acquire live memory from a Linux system using AVML
- Validate memory dump contents using strings and grep
- Securely transfer forensic data to another host for further analysis
- Understand the role of memory forensics in post-incident investigations
