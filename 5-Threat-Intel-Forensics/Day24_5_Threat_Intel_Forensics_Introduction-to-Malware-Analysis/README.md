# 🛡️ Day 24 – Introduction to Malware Analysis

## 🎯 Lab Objective
This lab introduces students to the basics of malware analysis. You’ll learn how to identify malicious files, analyze them statically using free tools, and extract indicators like file names, hashes, strings, and behavior — all without needing to run the malware.

## 🧠 What is Malware Analysis?
Malware Analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand its origin, behavior, impact, and indicators. It helps SOC analysts detect infections, contain threats, and prevent future compromises.

## 🔍 Types of Malware Analysis:

| **Type**       | **Description**                                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static Analysis     | Examining a file without executing it              |
| Memory Analysis     | Investigating malware artifacts in memory          |
| Reverse Engineering | Deconstructing the code (advanced)                 |

--- 

## ✅ Key Objectives:

- Identify the type of malware (e.g., trojan, ransomware, info-stealer)
- Determine how it spreads (email, USB, download, vulnerability)
- Understand its behavior (file modifications, network connections, persistence)
- Extract IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) (hashes, domains, IPs, registry keys)
- Help in detection and prevention (create YARA rules, update AV signatures, SIEM rules)
- Support incident response (understand timeline, impact, and cleanup strategy)


## 🧠 Static Malware Analysis – Activity, Purpose, and Tools

| **Activity**       | **Purpose**        | **Tools You Can Use**      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|🔍 Check File Hash (MD5/SHA256) | Identify file uniquely and compare with threat intel databases |  VirusTotal, HashCalc, HashMyFiles, PowerShell Get-FileHash  |
|🛑 Check Antivirus Detections   | See if AV engines detect the file as malicious | VirusTotal, MetaDefender, Hybrid Analysis |
| 📎 Inspect File Metadata | Gather file details like size, type, timestamps, compile date | ExifTool, PEStudio, Detect It Easy (DIE), file command  |
| Check File Type & Entropy |  Detect packing, encryption, or file manipulation  | Detect It Easy (DIE), PEStudio, binwalk | 
| 🧵 Extract Strings |  Reveal readable content like domains, URLs, commands  | strings, FLOSS (FireEye), BinText  |
| 🔐 Detect Obfuscation or Packing  | Identify if the file is packed to hide malicious code  |  PEiD, Detect It Easy (DIE), PEStudio      |
| 🌐 Scan Embedded Domains or URLs  |  Uncover external connections or phishing links | VirusTotal, CyberChef, URLScan.io  |
| 🔁 Analyze Imports/Functions  | Understand what Windows APIs or system calls the file uses  |  PEStudio, CFF Explorer, IDA Free, Ghidra  |
| 🧬 Compare to Known Malware Samples   |  Check similarity to known malware families or signatures | Intezer Analyze, Hybrid Analysis, VirusTotal Behavior   |
| 📦 Hex & Binary Inspection  | Manually examine binary structure for hidden artifacts  | HxD, Hexed.it, 010 Editor   |

## 🧪 Lab Tasks – Perform Static Malware Analysis

## 🛠️ Lab Setup: You will perform basic static malware analysis using a publicly known test malware file.

⚠️ I used a safe EICAR test file – not harmful, but detected by AV tools.

## 🔧 Tools You’ll Use:
- EICAR Test Malware Sample FIle
- VirusTotal
- Hybrid Analysis
- Any.Run (Optional)
- CyberChef
- Intezer Analyze (Optional)
- Strings or Hex Viewer (e.g., https://hexed.it)
