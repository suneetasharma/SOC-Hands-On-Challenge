# 🛡️ Day 24 – Introduction to Malware Analysis

## 🎯 Lab Objective
This lab introduces students to the basics of malware analysis. You’ll learn how to identify malicious files, analyze them statically using free tools, and extract indicators like file names, hashes, strings, and behavior — all without needing to run the malware.

## 🧠 What is Malware Analysis?
Malware Analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand its origin, behavior, impact, and indicators. It helps SOC analysts detect infections, contain threats, and prevent future compromises.

## 🔍 Types of Malware Analysis:

| **Type**       | **Description**                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static Analysis    | Examining a file without executing it                 |
| Memory Analysis | Investigating malware artifacts in memory              |
| Reverse Engineering  | Deconstructing the code (advanced) |

--- 

## ✅ Key Objectives:

- Identify the type of malware (e.g., trojan, ransomware, info-stealer)
- Determine how it spreads (email, USB, download, vulnerability)
- Understand its behavior (file modifications, network connections, persistence)
- Extract IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) (hashes, domains, IPs, registry keys)
- Help in detection and prevention (create YARA rules, update AV signatures, SIEM rules)
- Support incident response (understand timeline, impact, and cleanup strategy)


## 🧠 Static Malware Analysis – Activity, Purpose, and Tools
Activity	Purpose	Tools You Can Use
🔍 Check File Hash (MD5/SHA256)	Identify file uniquely and compare with threat intel databases	VirusTotal, HashCalc, HashMyFiles, PowerShell Get-FileHash
🛑 Check Antivirus Detections	See if AV engines detect the file as malicious	VirusTotal, MetaDefender, Hybrid Analysis
📎 Inspect File Metadata	Gather file details like size, type, timestamps, compile date	ExifTool, PEStudio, Detect It Easy (DIE), file command
🧪 Check File Type & Entropy	Detect packing, encryption, or file manipulation	Detect It Easy (DIE), PEStudio, binwalk
🧵 Extract Strings	Reveal readable content like domains, URLs, commands	strings, FLOSS (FireEye), BinText
🔐 Detect Obfuscation or Packing	Identify if the file is packed to hide malicious code	PEiD, Detect It Easy (DIE), PEStudio
🌐 Scan Embedded Domains or URLs	Uncover external connections or phishing links	VirusTotal, CyberChef, URLScan.io
🔁 Analyze Imports/Functions	Understand what Windows APIs or system calls the file uses	PEStudio, CFF Explorer, IDA Free, Ghidra
🧬 Compare to Known Malware Samples	Check similarity to known malware families or signatures	Intezer Analyze, Hybrid Analysis, VirusTotal Behavior
📦 Hex & Binary Inspection	Manually examine binary structure for hidden artifacts	HxD, Hexed.it, 010 Editor


## 🧪 Lab Tasks – Perform Static Malware Analysis

## 🛠️ Lab Setup: You will perform basic static malware analysis using a publicly known test malware file.

⚠️ I used a safe EICAR test file – not harmful, but detected by AV tools.

## 🔧 Tools You’ll Use:
- EICAR Test Malware Sample FIle
- VirusTotal
- Hybrid Analysis
- Any.Run (Optional)
- CyberChef
- Intezer Analyze (Optional)
- Strings or Hex Viewer (e.g., https://hexed.it)

## 📝 Submission Checklist
- ✅ Submit the following screenshots:
    - VirusTotal scan result with detection tab
    - Sandbox result (Hybrid Analysis or Any.Run)
    - CyberChef base64 decoding step
    - Any other interesting output or IOC

✅ Learning Outcome
In this lab, I:

- Understood what static malware analysis involves
- Used free tools to analyze suspicious files
- Learned how to extract hashes, strings, and AV detections
- Practiced documenting your findings like a SOC analyst
